# Signal Denoising Techniques: A Comparative Analysis

## Overview

This project provides a practical exploration and comparative analysis of three fundamental signal denoising methodologies: the **Classical Fourier Transform (CFT)**, the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**, and a **Deep Learning** approach. The primary objective is to understand the theoretical foundations, implement these techniques, and evaluate their performance in terms of **accuracy, computational efficiency, and suitability** for different signal types and noise conditions. This project serves as an excellent hands-on introduction to elementary signal analysis and modern denoising strategies.

## Methodologies

### 1. Classical Fourier Transform (CFT)

*   **Concept:** The CFT provides a continuous representation of a signal in the frequency domain. In practice, we approximate it using numerical integration techniques (like Simpson's rule) on discretized signals.
*   **Denoising Application:** Noise is often concentrated in high frequencies. Denoising is achieved by applying a **low-pass filter** in the frequency domain to attenuate these components before reconstructing the signal via the inverse transform.
*   **Limitations:** Computationally intensive for large datasets, making it impractical for real-time applications. It is primarily used here for its educational value in understanding the continuous-frequency perspective.

### 2. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

*   **Concept:** The FFT is an efficient algorithm (e.g., Cooley-Tukey) for calculating the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). It is the workhorse for digital signal processing.
*   **Denoising Application:** Similar to CFT, it transforms the signal to the frequency domain for filtering (low-pass, band-pass, etc.). Its speed allows for practical analysis of large, discrete signals.
*   **Advantages:** Drastically faster than a direct DFT computation or CFT approximation, enabling real-time processing on standard hardware.
*   **Considerations:** As a global transform, it can introduce artifacts like **spectral leakage** (if the signal is not periodic in the observation window) and **ringing** (Gibbs phenomenon) near sharp discontinuities.

### 3. Deep Learning (CNN-based)

*   **Architecture:** Employs a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** or a **Denoising Autoencoder**. These architectures are adept at learning hierarchical features from data.
*   **Training Process:** The model learns in a **supervised** manner. It is trained on a large dataset of pairs—`(noisy_signal, clean_signal)`—to map the former to the latter.
*   **Denoising Application:** The trained model directly outputs a denoised signal. It can learn complex, non-linear noise patterns that are difficult to model with traditional filters.
*   **Limitations:** Requires significant computational resources (GPUs) for training and a large, representative dataset. There is a risk of **overfitting** to the training data if the model is not properly regularized or the dataset is too small.

## Project Roadmap & Current Status

**Current Status: Phase 1 - Theoretical Foundation & Design**
We are currently finalizing the theoretical comparison and designing the experimental setup.

**Planned Implementation:**

*   **Phase 2: Data Acquisition & Synthesis**
    *   Collect clean signal datasets (e.g., ECG, audio, synthetic signals).
    *   Programmatically generate training and test data by adding various types of noise (e.g., Gaussian white noise, power-line interference).

*   **Phase 3: Algorithm Implementation**
    *   Implement the CFT-based denoiser using numerical integration.
    *   Implement the FFT-based denoiser with configurable low-pass filters.
    *   Design, build, and train a CNN model for denoising.

*   **Phase 4: Quantitative Evaluation & Analysis**
    *   Evaluate all techniques using standard metrics:
        *   **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
        *   **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)** improvement
        *   **Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)**
    *   Compare computational performance (execution time).
    *   Visually compare the denoised signals against the originals.

*   **Future Exploration:**
    *   Investigate hybrid approaches (e.g., using wavelet transforms as a pre-processor for deep learning).
    *   Optimize the deep learning model for specific signal types.
