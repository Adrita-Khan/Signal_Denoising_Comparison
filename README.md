## Introduction
Signal denoising is crucial in fields like telecommunications, audio processing, and biomedical engineering. It involves removing noise from a signal to recover the underlying true information. Traditional methods such as the Classical Fourier Transform (CFT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) have been widely used for this purpose. Recently, deep learning approaches have emerged as powerful alternatives. This project compares these three techniques—CFT, FFT, and deep learning—in terms of performance, accuracy, and noise reduction effectiveness using a synthetic dataset generated from a stochastic process.

## Synthetic Data Generation
To evaluate the denoising techniques, we generate a synthetic dataset consisting of 500,000 data points. The dataset simulates a stochastic process combining multiple sinusoidal signals with added Gaussian white noise.

### Signal Composition
**Underlying Signal (s(t))**:

![s(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{3} A_k \sin(2\pi f_k t + \phi_k)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?s(t)&space;=&space;\sum_{k=1}^{3}&space;A_k&space;\sin(2\pi&space;f_k&space;t&space;&plus;&space;\phi_k))

- **A<sub>k</sub>**: Amplitude of the k-th sinusoid
- **f<sub>k</sub>**: Frequency of the k-th sinusoid
- **φ<sub>k</sub>**: Phase shift of the k-th sinusoid

**Noise (n(t))**:
- Gaussian white noise with zero mean and specified variance.

### Parameters
- **Sampling Frequency (f<sub>s</sub>)**: 10,000 Hz
- **Duration (T)**: 50 seconds
- **Amplitudes**: A<sub>1</sub> = 1.0, A<sub>2</sub> = 0.5, A<sub>3</sub> = 0.8
- **Frequencies**: f<sub>1</sub> = 50 Hz, f<sub>2</sub> = 120 Hz, f<sub>3</sub> = 300 Hz
- **Phase Shifts (φ<sub>k</sub>)**: Randomly selected between 0 and 2π
- **Noise Variance**: Adjusted to achieve a desired Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)

### Data Generation Process
1. **Time Vector Creation**: 
   ![t = \text{linspace}(0, T, N)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?t&space;=&space;	ext{linspace}(0,&space;T,&space;N)), where **N** = 500,000.
2. **Signal Generation**: Generate the clean signal s(t) by summing the sinusoids with specified amplitudes, frequencies, and phase shifts.
3. **Noise Addition**: Add Gaussian white noise n(t) to the clean signal to produce the noisy signal:
   ![y(t) = s(t) + n(t)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?y(t)&space;=&space;s(t)&space;&plus;&space;n(t))

## Signal Denoising Techniques
### Classical Fourier Transform (CFT)
**Methodology**:
- Compute the continuous Fourier Transform to identify frequency components.
- Apply a low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency noise.

**Implementation**:
- Numerical approximation using integral methods.

**Considerations**:
- Computationally intensive for large datasets.
- Less efficient for discrete data.

### Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
**Methodology**:
- Utilize the FFT algorithm to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) efficiently.
- Implement frequency domain filtering (e.g., low-pass, high-pass filters).

**Implementation**:
- Use established libraries (e.g., NumPy's `fft` module).

**Considerations**:
- Significantly faster than CFT.
- Requires signal to be periodic and discrete.

### Deep Learning
**Methodology**:
- Train a neural network to map noisy signals to clean signals.
- The network learns to identify and suppress noise components.

**Architecture**:
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Denoising Autoencoder.
- **Layers**: Multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation, pooling layers, and batch normalization.

**Training**:
- **Dataset**: Use pairs of noisy and clean signals.
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.
- **Epochs**: 50–100, depending on convergence.

**Considerations**:
- Requires substantial computational resources for training.
- Generalizes well to similar types of noise and signals after training.

## Performance Metrics
To compare the techniques, we evaluate the following metrics:
- **Computational Time**: Time taken to perform denoising on the dataset.
- **Accuracy**:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average squared difference between the denoised signal and the true clean signal.
    ![\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( s(t_i) - \hat{s}(t_i) \right)^2](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?	ext{MSE}&space;=&space;rac{1}{N}&space;\sum_{i=1}^{N}&space;\left(&space;s(t_i)&space;-&space;\hat{s}(t_i)&space;
ight)^2)
  - **Signal-to-Noise Ratio Improvement (ΔSNR)**: Difference in SNR before and after denoising.
    ![Δ \text{SNR} = \text{SNR}_{\text{denoised}} - \text{SNR}_{\text{noisy}}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\Delta&space;	ext{SNR}&space;=&space;	ext{SNR}_{	ext{denoised}}&space;-&space;	ext{SNR}_{	ext{noisy}})
- **Noise Reduction Effectiveness**: Visual and quantitative assessment of residual noise in the denoised signal.
