# Signal Denoising Techniques: A Comparative Analysis

## Overview

This project explores and compares three distinct signal denoising methodologies—Classical Fourier Transform (CFT), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and Deep Learning—to assess their performance, accuracy, and effectiveness in noise reduction. The aim is to identify optimal approaches for various signal types and noise conditions.

## Methodologies

### Classical Fourier Transform (CFT)

* **Description:** Computes the continuous Fourier Transform through numerical integration.
* **Application:** Applies low-pass filtering to attenuate high-frequency noise components.
* **Limitations:** Computationally intensive for large datasets, making it less feasible for real-time applications.

### Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

* **Description:** Utilizes the Cooley-Tukey algorithm to efficiently compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).
* **Application:** Implements frequency domain filtering (low-pass/high-pass) to remove noise.
* **Advantages:** Significantly faster than CFT, especially for discrete signals, enabling real-time processing.
* **Considerations:** May introduce artifacts like ringing due to global frequency domain operations.

### Deep Learning

* **Architecture:** Employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Denoising Autoencoders for learning-based denoising.
* **Training:** Requires a substantial dataset of noisy and clean signal pairs for supervised learning.
* **Process:** Maps noisy signals to clean signals through learned patterns and representations.
* **Limitations:** Demands significant computational resources and large datasets; potential overfitting if not properly regularized.

## Current Status

This project is in the ideation phase, focusing on the theoretical comparison of these denoising techniques. Future steps include:

* **Dataset Collection:** Gathering diverse signal datasets with varying noise characteristics.
* **Implementation:** Developing and implementing each denoising technique for comparative analysis.
* **Evaluation:** Assessing performance using metrics such as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
* **Optimization:** Exploring hybrid approaches combining classical and deep learning methods for enhanced denoising.
